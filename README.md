# Wave Function Collapse Visualization
![](res/preview.gif)

This neat little application allows users to behold the power of the Wave Function Collapse algorithm by creating random generative pictures of [mostly not functional] PCBs.

## How to build [for Windows]
1. ```git clone``` the repository
2. Run  ```git submodule init``` and ```git submodule update``` to download the SFML Library (it will take some time and may seem stuck, but be patient)
3. Build the SFML library accroding to this tutorial: https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/compile-with-cmake.php
4. Run "build.bat"
5. Run /res/WFC.exe

## How to use:
- Wait for the algorithm to finish its sketch
- Press "Backspace" to start over
